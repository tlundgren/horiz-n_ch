Drivers must pick up fuel during races. While developers made available cheats to unlock cars and circuits, picking fuel is still imperative to finish races.

## Objectives
1-Finish races whether fuel is picked up or not.

## Work
1-Nope function DxxxxxxFxxx, class XxxXxxxXxxx, library Assembly-CSharp. This has the car finishing the race with the same amount of fuel with which it started (loss of fuel due to a car accident is also prevented).

2-As an alternative to 1), it is possible to modify fuel depletion rates in the global configuration class. For example, to slow the rate of consumption to half the original rate, the value must be divided by two.

The application does not use il2cpp - .net assemblies are available.
